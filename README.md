# Lymph-Graph
MVP of medical software for monitoring and diagnosing metastatic processes in the lymphatic system,
using an AVL tree whose nodes correspond to the nodes of a graph built on the lymphatic system 
and include a complex parameter calculated based on biological data.

### Features
- Self-balancing anomaly prioritization using AVL Tree.
- Random Forestâ€“based biological parameter encoding.
- Interactive graph visualization with Plotly.

### Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy - data handling
- Scikit-Learn - encoding/decoding complex parameter
- NetworkX - creating lymph graph
- PLotly - interactive visualization
